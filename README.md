# HateSpeech_prediction_InMACHINE_LEARNING

Hate speech is one of the serious issues we see on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook daily. Most of the posts containing hate speech can be 
found in the accounts of people with political views. 

There is no legal definition of hate speech because people’s opinions cannot easily be classified as hateful or offensive. 
Nevertheless, the United Nations defines hate speech as any type of verbal, written or behavioural communication that can attack or use discriminatory 
language regarding a person or a group of people based on their identity based on religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, ancestry, gender or 
any other identity factor.

The dataset I’m using for the hate speech detection task is downloaded from Kaggle. This dataset was originally collected from Twitter and contains the 
following columns:
